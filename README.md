# Technical note
Removed typescript flag and NODE_PATH support
We've removed the deprecated typescript flag when creating a new app. Use --template typescript instead. We've also dropped deprecated NODE_PATH flag as this has been replaced by setting the base path in jsconfig.json.

- Solution : created jsconfig.json
